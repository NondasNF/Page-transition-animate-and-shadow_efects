# Page-transition-animate-and-shadow_efects
 Medium level project to put CSS concepts into practice, focusing on transition, shadow effects, animation

### About the project
All design and content was copied from a third party site(http://www.milionariocomyoutube.com/#),
all content is the responsibility of the owner, my goal is just to learn from the effects used 
without directly copying any part of the code.
